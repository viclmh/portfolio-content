		<div>
			<p>
				This project is mainly about designing a personalized twitch resources system where I built a full-stack
				web application for users to search twitch videos and get recommendations. In this project, I used the
				three layer model, presentation tier, logic tier and data tier. In the presentation tier, I used the
				Spring MVC and React. In the logic tier, I used the Spring framework. In the data tier, I used hibernate
				to operate the MySQL database. Overall, in the front end, the webpage displayed the twitch videos in
				different categories, users can login their accounts to retrieve the videos they want to see and add
				their favorites into their accounts. The backend
				implemented the Restful API for users to retrieve the resources. Also, the recommendation algorithms
				were implemented in the backend to give recommendations according to the user's favorite videos.
			</p>
			<p>
				In summary, the project covered the following aspects:
				<br>
				<br>
				1.Built a web page with rich+ user friendly experience using React and Ant Design.
				<br>
				<br>
				2.Implemented RESTful APIs using Java servlets, retrieved real Twitch resources using Twitch API and
				stored data in MySQL.
				<br>
				<br>
				3.Support login/logout and favorite collection.
				<br>
				<br>
				4.Explored multiple recommendation algorithms and extracted game information from Twitch resources to
				implement a Content-based algorithm.
				<br>
				<br>
				5.Deployed the service to AWS EC2 for better stability.
				<br>
				<br>
				The Spring Framework used in this project is the most widely used framework for the development of Java
				Enterprise Edition applications, specifically, web applications. The Spring Framework is divided into
				modules. At the heart are the modules of the core container, including a configuration model and a
				dependency injection mechanism. The main usage of Spring core is to create all the objects (for example,
				objects that connect to database, business logic related class, etc) that your application is required
				for running and dependency injection to achieve the loosely decouple.
