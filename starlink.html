		<p>
			React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for
			building user interfaces based on UI components. React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. It helps
			design simple views for each state in the application, and it will efficiently update and render just the
			right components when the data changes. React is also component -based, it builds encapsulated components
			that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in
			JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the
			DOM. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native, and we can
			develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.

			Starlink is the world's first and largest satellite constellation using a low Earth orbit to deliver
			broadband internet capable of supporting streaming, online gaming, video calls and more. Leveraging advanced
			satellites and user hardware coupled with deep experience with both spacecraft and on-orbit operations,
			Starlink delivers high-speed, low-latency internet to users all over the world. So in this project, I
			designed and developed a visualization dashboard using ReactJS and D3 to track starlink satellites in
			real-time based on Geolocation. In general, the project is finished by the following steps:
			<br>
			<br>
			1.Designed and developed a visualization dashboard using ReactJS and D3 to track satellites in real-time
			based on Geolocation.
			<br>
			<br>
			2.Built location, altitude, and duration based selector to refine satellite search.
			<br>
			<br>
			3.Animated selected satellite paths on a world map using D3 to improve the user-friendliness.
			<br>
			<br>
			4.Deployed the dashboard to AWS for demonstration.
