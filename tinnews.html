		<p>
			Android is a Linux based operating system for mobile phones, tablets, and a growing range of devices
			encompassing everything from wearable computing to in-car entertainment (Portable Device, Smart Device,
			Smart Home, Auto App). Actually, Android is an open source project called AOSP(Android Open Source Project).
			Google uses this project as a base to create its version of Android, which is then used by the other
			manufacturers. It is the most popular smartphone operating system in the world by volume and iOS developers
			are more saturated in the US. Android has lower entry requirements: familiar to Java, no need for a MAC, no
			$99 per year developer fees. Learning Android will help developers pick up other mobile frameworks easily.
			Therefore, in this project, I learned a lot about Android knowledge and designed a mobile application about
			news.

		</p>
		<p>
			The Tinnews application is a Instagram Flavor News app based on Google Component Architectural MVVM Pattern.
			Generally, this project covered Android topics and concepts such as Views, Activity & Fragment, Lifecycle,
			Network, MVVM(Model-View-ViewModel), Navigation Graph, Recycler View, UI/Main Thread and Multithreading and
			Room. And I finished this project based on the following steps:
			<br>
			<br>
			1. Designed the Instagram Flavor News app based on Google Component Architectural MVVM Pattern
			<br>
			<br>
			2. Implemented the bottom bar & page navigation using JetPack navigation component
			<br>
			<br>
			3. Utilized Mindorksâ€™s PlaceHolderView to support swipe gestures for liking/disliking the news
			<br>
			<br>
			4. Built the Room Database with LiveData & ViewModel to support local cache and offline model
			<br>
			<br>
			5. Integrated Retrofit and Rxjava to pull the latest news data from a RESTFUL endpoint (newsapi.org).
